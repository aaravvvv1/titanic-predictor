# Titanic Survival Predictor ðŸš¢

This project is an interactive web application that predicts the survival probability of a passenger on the RMS Titanic. It uses a machine learning model trained on the classic Kaggle "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset. The entire project, from data cleaning and model training to building the web interface, is included.

## Features

  * **Interactive Prediction:** Users can input passenger details (Class, Age, Sex, etc.) through a user-friendly interface.
  * **Live Predictions:** The app uses a pre-trained Logistic Regression model to provide a real-time survival prediction.
  * **Confidence Score:** Displays the model's confidence in its prediction as a percentage.
  * **Data Analysis:** The included Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic_Analysis.ipynb`) provides a complete walkthrough of the data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training process.

## Tech Stack

  * **Language:** Python 3
  * **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy
  * **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
  * **Web Framework:** Streamlit
  * **Development Environment:** VS Code, Jupyter Notebook

## Setup and Usage

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/titanic-predictor.git
    cd titanic-predictor
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

    ```bash
    # Create the venv
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the Streamlit App**
    Launch the web application with the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

    Your web browser will automatically open with the app running.
